                            <h2>I'm Liam Herman, a developer and designer</h2>
                            <p>
                                Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Liam, a passionate web designer and developer with a knack for creating visually stunning and user-friendly websites. With a background in both design and development, I bridge the gap between aesthetic appeal and technical functionality.
                                <br><br>My journey in web design began 6 years ago when I discovered my love for combining creativity with technology. Since then, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various other web technologies. My expertise also extends to tools like Figma and Illustrator, which I use to craft compelling designs.
                                <br><br>I believe that great design is more than just how it looks; it's about how it works. My goal is to create seamless digital experiences that engage users and drive results. Whether it's a dynamic poster, an animated typography, or a full-fledged website, I approach each project with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence.
                                <br><br>One of my favorite projects has been the "CSS ZenGarden Challenge," where I transformed a basic HTML structure into a Brutalist masterpiece using only CSS. This project showcased my ability to adhere to a specific design theme while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with CSS.
